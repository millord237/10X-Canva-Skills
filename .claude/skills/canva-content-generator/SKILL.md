5. **Output for Use** - Ready for other skills to apply

## Using Sample References

The `samples/` folder contains user preferences:

### Analyzing Samples

```python
# Analyze user's image style preferences
python skills/canva-content-generator/scripts/analyze_samples.py \
  --type images

# Get brand voice from presentations
python skills/canva-content-generator/scripts/analyze_samples.py \
  --type presentations

# Extract color preferences
python skills/canva-content-generator/scripts/extract_colors.py \
  --folder "samples/color-palettes"

# Analyze text style
python skills/canva-content-generator/scripts/analyze_text_style.py \
  --samples "samples/images/social-media"
```

## 3-Mode Workflow

### MODE 1: PLAN

1. **Understand the Need**
   ```
   - What type of content? (headline, caption, outline)
   - What design will it be used for? (Instagram, presentation)
   - What's the purpose? (promote, inform, entertain)
   - Target audience?
   ```

2. **Check Sample Preferences**
   ```python
   # Load user's style preferences
   python skills/canva-content-generator/scripts/analyze_samples.py \
     --type images/social-media
   ```

3. **Document Content Plan**
   ```
   ## Content Generation Plan

   ### Request
   - Need: Instagram post caption
   - Topic: New product launch
   - Tone: Exciting, modern

   ### User Preferences (from samples)
   - Style: Minimal, clean
   - Emoji usage: Moderate
   - Hashtag strategy: 10-15 relevant
   - CTA style: Direct

   ### Will Generate
   - 3 headline options
   - 3 caption variations
   - Hashtag suggestions
   ```

### MODE 2: CLARIFY

Content-specific questions:

1. **Tone and Voice**
   - "Should this be formal or casual?"
   - "Playful or professional?"

2. **Constraints**
   - "Any character limits?"
   - "Required keywords or hashtags?"

3. **Brand Alignment**
   - "Match your usual style or try something new?"
   - "Include emojis?"

4. **Purpose**
   - "Drive sales, build awareness, or engage?"
   - "What action should viewers take?"

### MODE 3: IMPLEMENT

Generate content and save to output:

```python
# Generate headlines
python skills/canva-content-generator/scripts/generate_headlines.py \
  --topic "Summer Sale" \

  --output "output/content/headlines.txt"

# Generate social captions

  --platform instagram \
  --topic "Product Launch" \

2. **Sentence Structure** - Short punchy vs. flowing
3. **Emoji Usage** - Heavy, moderate, none
4. **Tone** - Formal, casual, playful
5. **CTA Style** - Direct, subtle, urgent
6. **Hashtag Strategy** - Count, type, placement

## Brand Kit Integration

If brand kit exists in `samples/brand-kits/`:

```json
{
  "brand_name": "Acme Corp",
  "tagline": "Innovation Made Simple",
  "voice": "professional yet approachable",
  "values": ["innovation", "simplicity", "trust"],
  "avoid": ["complicated", "jargon", "corporate-speak"],
  "emoji_style": "minimal",
  "hashtags": ["#AcmeCorp", "#InnovationMadeSimple"]
}
```

Content will automatically align with brand guidelines.
